 hibernate : hibernate is a java framework that simplifies the development of java application to interact with the data base .
            // When we are in JDBC then SQL Query is written by us , this problem can semplify from the hebernate.
            //hibernate is ORM(object relational mapping ) tool : this means that the object of java class is mapped with 
               the table of the database
            //  hibernate is an open source(free), lightweight (based on -pjos(plane java objects) simple-simple java classes))
            // hibernate is non-invasive framework or lossely coupled, means it won't forces the programmers to extend/implement 
               any class/interface
            // it is invented by Gavin King in 2001.
            // Any type of application can build with hibernate framework use in build persistance logic(Spring-web ,swing application 
             ,fx application,java web,spring boot application).
    
//  Traditional way to Save the Data(JDBC): in this we write the sql query manually to store 

//  when we want to store the data to database then only one task we have to do ,bring that object class to  hiberate then maaping is 
   done ,just you need to specify the rows and columns and which class is mapped with which table you have to map. 
 // to create the hibernate project you just need to follow the serveral steps 
    
     // create a maven project then click on next then select the catalog(internal) - filters-(quick start)
 
      // add hibernate core relocation and mysql connector j  depedency in pom.xml file 	
       // create a xml file name (hibernate.cfg.xml)just a stanadad name we hava to follow in src/java

       // for first time there is error in eclipes external file downlad go on window then go on prefernce then go on maven and tick the 
            check box  of downlad repo and java doc artifact
